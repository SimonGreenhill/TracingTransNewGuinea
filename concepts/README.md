# Readme

The files in this directory are intended to help extract the best subset of data for analysis.

Two commands:

1. concepts.py - simply tallies the concepts in the dataset.

2. synonyms.py - counts the number of synonyms in the dataset.

Important files:

* swadesh200.csv -- the concepts that belong in the swadesh 200 list
* concepts.final.csv -- the final (manually edited) concept list
